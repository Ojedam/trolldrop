AirDrop trollfaces to everyone. :trollface:

## Usage

Just run `trolldrop` and it will start airdropping continuously. There is an optional argument for specifiying the interval in seconds, it defaults to every 15 seconds.

```bash
$ ./trolldrop 2
ðŸ’» Alexsander Akers - ðŸ‘¨ iPhone
ðŸ‘¹ ðŸ”œ Alexsander Akers
```

Note: tested on OS X 10.11.1, may not work on other versions because it uses private API.

## Installation

The easiest way is installation via homebrew:

```bash
$ brew install neonichu/formulae/trolldrop
```

You can also clone the repo and build it from source, of course.

## Thanks

Thanks to [a2](https://twitter.com/a2) for unlocking his phone all the time to let me test this, because AirDrop didn't work on my phone (not due to this tool :joy:). Thanks to the movie [ðŸ¦€](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3464902/) for keeping me entertained while making this.
